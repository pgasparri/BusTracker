This is a "commit" message = changes, implementations, suggestions, etc. 

This message is updating the "README" file in the 'new branch demo' branch because that's the branch I was working on. 

Note: The README file in the 'master' branch is still the original README file with no content. 

This commit could be merged from the 'new branch demo' to the original 'master' branch by using a pull request, which I believe would update the original README file. 

So we can have as many branches as we want to work on, look at, and accept changes. And can merge them to the original master branch once they are confirmed by the whole team.
